Picture this scenario: You and a friend both find yourselves in the classic dilemma of choosing a movie to watch together. 
The argument goes on for hours, each of you having 2 different movies in mind, unable to come to a conclusion. 
If only you could combine both options and generate a movie that would fit to the interest of both parties...
